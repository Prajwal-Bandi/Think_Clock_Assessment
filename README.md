# Assessment Submission - File Handling and Dataset Inspection

## 📌 Project Description

This project is part of an assessment where the task was to write a Python script that:
- Traverses a directory containing a dataset.
- Lists and prints file names.
- Demonstrates basic file system operations using Python.
- Ensures the script limits output after a certain number of files for clarity.

All coding was done in **Python** using a **Jupyter Notebook** environment for better interactivity and readability.

## 📁 Dataset Path

The script walks through the following local directory:


> Note: The directory path is handled using a **raw string** to prevent issues with backslashes on Windows systems.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Uses Python's built-in `os` module to walk through directories.
- Limits the number of files printed for performance (e.g., first 10 files).
- Demonstrates basic usage of `numpy` and `pandas` for further processing (if needed).

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `os` – for directory traversal  
- `numpy` – for numerical operations  
- `pandas` – for data handling  

---

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) in a Jupyter environment.
2. Ensure the dataset exists in the path mentioned or update the path accordingly.
3. Run all cells to view the printed list of files.

## 📤 Output

The script prints the full path of each file in the dataset folder up to a specified limit (default is 10), followed by a message:
